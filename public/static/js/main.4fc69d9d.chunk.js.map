She got her start in journalism as an editor at the Hollsville County Times in Missouri. When the newspaper went out of business, a colleague persuaded her to enter the field of broadcasting. She moved to Oregon to begin a master's degree in broadcast journalism at Atlas University. Following graduation, she was able to begin her career as a local newscaster with WPSU-TV in Seattle, Washington, and rapidly advanced to national television. Noted for her quick wit and trenchant commentary, her name has since become synonymous with Good Day, America!

Hij stier in 1669 in Amsterdam. Hij wordt algemeen gezien als een van de belangrijkste schilders van de Gouden Eeuw, een zeer belangrijke periode in de Nederlandse geschiedenis waarin het land een ongekende economische en culturele groei doormaakte. Er is maar weinig over zijn leven bekend, maar we weten dat hij door zijn ouders op 14-jarige leeftijd in de leer is gedaan bij de Leidse schilder Jacob van Swanenburgh en later nog een korte tijd bij de Amsterdamse schilder Pieter Lastman.  Hij opende zijn eerste eigen atelier in Leiden in 1627, waar hij de eerste paar jaren van zijn carriére door zou brengen. Hier gingen ook de schilders Gerrit Dou en Isaac de Jouderville bij hem in de leer. In 1631 kreeg hij zoveel opdrachten uit Amsterdam dat hij naar die stad verhuisde, om een atelier te openen in het gebouw dat nu bekend staat als het Rembrandthuis en openstaat voor het publiek.  In Amsterdam schilderde Rembrandt tussen 1639 en 1642 ook zijn beroemdste schilderij, de Nachtwacht. Het is een afbeelding van de schutterij van Amsterdam, een groep rijkere burgers die zich hadden verenigd om bij een aanval de stad te verdedigen en om de orde te handhaven. Deze groepen lieten zich vaak vereeuwigen op een schilderij, maar Rembrandt pakte het anders aan dan men gewend was: in plaats van een statig portret, schilderde hij een dynamische groep die net bezig is zich voor te bereiden om eropuit te gaan. Hierdoor is een levendig beeld ontstaan, waarbij de verschillende personen op het schilderij allemaal met iets anders bezig zijn. Tegenwoordig wordt de Nachtwacht als een meesterwerk gezien, maar in de tijd van Rembrandt was men er minder blij mee: zijn vernieuwende stijl zorgde voor een schok en veel leden van de Schutterij waren boos dat ze niet goed te zien waren. Rembrandt kreeg weinig geld voor zijn werk, en toen het doek een aantal jaren later in het stadhuis van Amsterdam werd opgehangen, vond men het zelfs geen probleem om links en rechts een grote strook af te snijden. Nu is men er gelukkig zuiniger op en hangt het op een prominente plaats in het Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.
